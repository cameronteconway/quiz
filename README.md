# quiz - designed and developed by Cameron Conway

This aim of this project is to demonstrate and expand upon my understanding of Redux, and to incorporate that within a React web app. I chose to use geography as the category for the application as it is a topic I'm interested in and wouldn't bore me when testing the functionality of the quizzes. I have opted for a simplistic design, which I feel helps users navigate the application.

## Technologies

This project is built using the frontend JavaScript library [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) to manage state.
