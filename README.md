The aim of this project has been to create a clean, user friendly and accessible homepage for an institution of education, specifically a university. The page has has been split into resuable components of which the data is fetched from a static JavaScript file (/src/data/data.js). It is important that an institution of education is inclusive and meets the needs of all individuals, this has been considered in the development with a specific focus on accessibility. The content is clean and spaced out and flows offering a clear user journey.
